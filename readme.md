## Image Processing Code

This project is a bunch of code for basic digital image processing techniques. 
Right now this code contains spatial and frequency domain image processing techniques, as well as some unfinished compression and edge detection code. 

## Motivation

Motivation for this project comes from an interest in image processing and how the mathematics behind it works.  I'm rewriting basic algorithms to understand how everything works.  

## Installation

Written in MATLAB 2011, requires 2011 or later editions for certain commands

Drop whatever code you want in your 'current folder' in MATLAB and make sure the image is also in the folder.  Images are from the text 'Digital Image Processing' 3rd Edition, by Gonzalez and Woods and can be downloaded from their website http://www.imageprocessingplace.com/
